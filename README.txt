# LOGIN-REGISTRATION-using-php-and-sql
Made a login registration form using php ,sql.html &amp; css 

Install xampp on your device to see the project

start the apache server and the MySql too.
where xampp is installed go to htdocs folder and paste the project folder in it.
then on the php my admin create a user account in my name or you can make changes in your own wish
then create a database named log_reg
then in that create a table named register
in which add 6 columns
1.id 
2.name
3.email
4.password
5.user_type
6.phone

then open login.php in the browser 
so first you have to register to login
so down there is a option to register and register and make a account and remember the
password
and then go to login and and login there 
and you can  see your dashboard and you can logout too.

thank you pls support me for more projects.
